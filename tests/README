To make the tests go:

you need to compile main.go:
	go build main.go
	it is a very simple syslog wrapper, since HAProxy only logs to syslog.
	Otherwise alter tmuxp.json (or ignore tmux and do it all by hand.)
you need tmux (https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
you need tmuxp (https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp)
you need curl: (https://curl.haxx.se/)
you need python2 (or some other simple https server running.)
you need haproxy and vault binaries in your path.
you need the hapvault requirements(see main readme)

The tests are pretty miserable, and still mostly done by hand, but this is a reasonable start at showing it all working. so maybe it's an example more than it is tests, whatever.

Feel free to send better tests!

edit tmuxp.json the shell_command_before needs to point to your copy of hapvault's repo.
